  subtitle:'Chapter 11 — Team Organization, Communication, and Operational Practice',
  chapter:11,
  intro:'<p>This chapter explains how ACTT-level care is executed safely through deliberate team organization. The focus is not only on what clinical actions must be taken, but on how the team communicates, assigns work, reassesses, and maintains control of a high-acuity patient from first contact through prolonged holding.</p><p>In the shipboard setting, communication and team structure are not secondary skills. They directly affect airway safety, medication accuracy, procedure success, trend recognition, and escalation timing. The practical aim of this chapter is to turn clinical knowledge into coordinated action under pressure.</p><h4>Why This Chapter Matters (11.2)</h4><p>In trauma, shock, airway compromise, burns, sepsis, and prolonged holding, many failures occur despite correct knowledge of the underlying condition. The breakdown often happens because no one clearly owns the plan, tasks are assumed rather than assigned, deterioration is not spoken aloud, or handovers omit the detail needed to continue safe care.</p><p>At sea, these risks are amplified by reduced staffing, fatigue, interrupted workflow, environmental noise, watch changes, and delayed outside support. For that reason, ACTT-relevant performance must include leadership discipline, closed-loop communication, documentation habits, and realistic workload planning.</p><h4>How to Use This Chapter (11.3)</h4><p>This chapter should be used as a practical operations guide. During study, the learner should repeatedly ask: Who is leading? What is the current problem list? What is the next action? Who is assigned to reassessment? What would trigger escalation? What must be handed over if another person takes over care?</p><p>The goal is to make team function explicit. A good team response is not improvised. It is built from a few reliable habits that are repeated during acute response, procedures, transport, and prolonged casualty management.</p>',

        '<h4>11.4.1 One Clear Clinical Lead</h4>' +
        '<p>One person must hold the overall clinical plan. The lead may be the person performing a task initially, but once multiple actions are happening at once, someone must maintain the broader view. The lead defines priorities, assigns work, confirms what has and has not been done, and determines when the next escalation step is required.</p>' +
        '<p>A frequent failure pattern is that the most senior or most experienced person becomes absorbed in a single procedure and no one is left tracking the whole patient. If that happens, the team should explicitly re-state who now owns the overall plan.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.4.2 Shared Mental Model</h4>' +
        '<p>Everyone involved should understand the main diagnosis or working problem list, the immediate threats, the interventions already performed, and the next likely failure point. A shared mental model prevents teams from splitting into parallel but uncoordinated efforts.</p>' +
        '<p>When the patient changes, the plan must be re-stated out loud. This is especially important after airway placement, decompression, seizure termination, new hypotension, rising oxygen requirement, or any transition from acute rescue into prolonged holding.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.4.3 Closed-Loop Communication</h4>' +
        '<p>Critical instructions should be stated clearly, repeated back, and confirmed when complete. This is especially important for medication dosing, infusion changes, airway steps, device checks, and timed reassessments.</p>' +
        '<p>Closed-loop communication reduces silent task failure. It is one of the simplest ways to prevent missed doses, duplicated interventions, and the false assumption that someone else is handling the problem.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.4.4 Reassessment Is a Team Function</h4>' +
        '<p>Reassessment should never be assumed. A named person must be responsible for repeat vitals, device checks, fluid and medication timing, and re-evaluation after interventions. The lead should explicitly ask whether the patient is better, worse, or unchanged and whether any new complication has appeared.</p>' +
        '<p>Without assigned reassessment, the team tends to focus on the intervention itself rather than on whether it actually fixed the problem.</p>',

        '<h4>11.5.1 Responsibilities of the Clinical Lead</h4>' +
        '<p>The clinical lead should maintain an active problem list, set immediate priorities, decide which procedures and medications are required, and anticipate the next likely deterioration. The lead must also watch the workload of the team. An excellent clinical plan can still fail if it requires more people, monitoring, or continuity than the ship can realistically provide.</p>' +
        '<p>In prolonged holding, the lead must ensure the team shifts from rescue thinking to sustained management: scheduled reassessments, medication continuity, trend documentation, and clear trigger points for re-contacting outside support.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.5.2 Leadership During High-Acuity Interventions</h4>' +
        '<p>Before RSI, chest decompression, chest tube insertion, seizure escalation, or pressor initiation, the lead should slow the team briefly enough to state the plan, confirm equipment, assign roles, and define the backup plan if the first attempt fails.</p>' +
        '<p>The lead should control pace. A rushed team without a stated contingency is more dangerous than a briefly paused team with a clear plan.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.5.3 Leadership Failure Patterns</h4>' +
        '<p>Common leadership failures include: no clear lead, task fixation, failure to update the plan when the patient changes, and assuming others are monitoring without assigning it. Each of these is preventable if the team states the lead, states the problem list, and states the next check as well as the next treatment.</p>',

      content:'<h3>11.6 Role Assignment and Task Organization</h3>' +
        '<p>In a small clinical team, one person may hold multiple functions, but the functions should still be named. Typical roles include clinical lead, airway or procedure operator, medication and equipment support, monitor/recorder, and runner or general support. Clear assignment prevents duplication and omission.</p>' +
        '<p>Role assignment should occur before procedures, during deterioration, and again after any major change in acuity. If new personnel enter the scene, roles should be re-declared so that the team does not drift into assumption-based work.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.6.1 Role Assignment Before a Procedure</h4>' +
        '<p>Before a procedure, the team should define who performs, who monitors, who passes equipment, who prepares or administers medications, who documents, and who is the immediate backup if the procedure fails. This is not bureaucracy; it is a direct safety step that reduces delay and confusion once the procedure begins.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.6.2 Preventing Role Drift</h4>' +
        '<p>Roles blur over time, especially in a 24-72 hour hold. Fatigue, repeated interruptions, and the arrival of additional personnel can cause responsibility to become unclear. The team should re-state responsibilities at set intervals and after each handover.</p>',

        '<h4>11.7.1 Declaring the Situation Clearly</h4>' +
        '<p>The first useful communication in an emergency is a concise statement of the problem and the immediate threat. For example: "Severe TBI with falling GCS, airway may be lost soon" or "Suspected tension physiology, decompression now." Vague statements delay action because they force the team to interpret the urgency for themselves.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.7.2 Giving Clear Clinical Orders</h4>' +
        '<p>Orders should include the specific action, dose or amount where relevant, route or device if relevant, and timing. "Give ketamine 1 mg/kg IV now" is safe and actionable. "Give some sedation" is not. Ambiguous orders create medication errors, duplicated work, and unnecessary delay.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.7.3 Calling Out Critical Changes</h4>' +
        '<p>Falling SpO2, worsening BP, rising agitation, recurrent seizure activity, increasing pressor requirement, decreasing urine output, and device malfunction should be spoken aloud as soon as they are recognized. Waiting for certainty is often how teams lose the salvage window.</p>',

This creates alignment before the procedure starts.</p>' +
        '<p>During the procedure, key milestones should be called out: medication given, paralysis onset, airway view, tube passed, decompression performed, pleural entry, IO flush confirmed, and so on. Afterward, the team should immediately confirm whether the procedure worked, what changed, and what now needs monitoring.</p>',

        '<p>Documentation is part of safe care. In acute care it captures times, findings, medications, procedures, and immediate response. In prolonged holding it becomes even more important because it preserves trends, prevents duplicate dosing, supports handovers, and allows teleconsultation to be based on reliable data rather than memory.</p>' +
        '<p>Good documentation includes exact times, exact doses, current drip rates, device placements and checks, neuro trends, fluids in and out, and clear notes on whether the patient improved, worsened, or remained unchanged after each major action.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.9.1 Documentation Failure Patterns</h4>' +
        '<p>Common failures include missing times, undocumented reassessment, no running total of sedatives or opioids, no trend record, and notes that record what was done without stating what happened afterward. These gaps directly increase risk during shift change and prolonged holding.</p>',

        '<p>Handover is one of the most dangerous moments in patient care because responsibility can become unclear while the patient continues to evolve. A structured handover should include who the patient is, what happened, what the current problem list is, what has been done, the current status, what may fail next, what must be checked next, and what has not yet been done but may soon be required.</p>' +
        '<p>This same structure should be used for shift change, temporary relief, movement to another care space, transfer to a MEDEVAC team, and updates during teleconsultation.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.10.1 High-Risk Handover Omissions</h4>' +
        '<p>Common dangerous omissions include the time of the last sedative, current pressor dose, airway status, unresolved device concerns, worsening trends, pending reassessments, and consultant recommendations. These omissions are precisely the details that often determine the next complication.</p>',

        '<p>Remote support is a communication task as much as a medical one. Before calling, the team should prepare a concise clinical summary, current vitals, trend data, major interventions already performed, active medications and infusions, onboard capability, and a specific question or decision point.</p>' +
        '<p>The most effective structure is simple: state the problem, state the current status, state what has already been done, state what you need help deciding. Long, unstructured chronology without prioritization wastes time and obscures the actual decision point.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.11.1 Integrating Remote Advice</h4>' +
        '<p>Once advice is received, it should be converted into bedside tasks. The lead should clarify any ambiguity, assign resulting actions, document the recommendation, and confirm what new trigger should prompt re-contact. Advice that is not translated into explicit tasks is not operationally useful.</p>',

This communication should be concise and operationally focused.</p>' +
        '<p>Non-clinical personnel can be valuable when used deliberately.

        '<p>Acute care teamwork must evolve into sustainable care teamwork. The team should establish a reassessment rhythm, a device check rhythm, a medication timing rhythm, and a handover rhythm. The patient should never be left in a vague "keep an eye on him" state. Someone must know exactly what needs checking, how often, and what finding requires immediate escalation.</p>' +
        '<p>Fatigue is a major threat during long holds. Teams should assume that attention will drift unless the system is structured to prevent it. That means written schedules, explicit task ownership, and repeated re-declaration of current priorities.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.13.1 Re-Declaring Deterioration</h4>' +
        '<p>If the patient worsens, the team must deliberately switch from maintenance mode back to acute response mode. The lead should say so out loud, restate the immediate threat, and reassign tasks as if starting a new event. Without this reset, teams often continue routine monitoring while the patient is actively failing.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.14 Operational Practice in Simulations and Real Events</h4>' +
        '<p>This chapter should also improve performance during course simulations. The same habits that improve real care also improve scenario performance: state findings out loud, verbalize priorities, assign roles early, narrate key interventions, communicate reassessment clearly, and declare escalation points.</p>' +
        '<p>Common scenario failures include silence, assumed tasks, no one tracking time or medications, no stated backup plan, and no explicit recognition that the first plan has failed. These are exactly the habits the learner should correct before the course.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.15 Common Team and Communication Failure Points</h4>' +
        '<p>The most common failures are predictable: unclear lead, vague orders, no read-back, no documented reassessment, incomplete handover, delayed call for help, and monitoring plans that exceed available staffing. These should be treated as system problems, not isolated personal errors. The solution is to build repeatable habits that make the correct action easier under stress.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.16 Practical Team Rules for Shipboard Care</h4>' +
        '<p>The core practical rules are straightforward: say the lead out loud, say the problem list out loud, assign the next check as well as the next treatment, confirm critical tasks closed-loop, and hand over before you think you need to. These five habits prevent a large share of avoidable breakdowns in shipboard acute care and prolonged holding.</p>' +

        '<h4>11.17 What the Learner Should Be Able to Do After This Chapter</h4>' +
