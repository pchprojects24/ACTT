              <li>Repeat in 7–10 days (to kill newly hatched lice)</li>

          </li>

          <li>Treatment of scabies (5% cream)</li>
          <li>Treatment of head lice, pubic lice (crabs) - typically 1% formulation but 5% can be used off-label</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h3>Contraindications / cautions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypersensitivity to permethrin, pyrethrins, or chrysanthemums</li>
          <li>Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, nose, and mucous membranes</li>
          <li>Not for oral or vaginal use</li>
          <li>Pregnancy/lactation: Generally considered safe topically (limited systemic absorption); use when benefit outweighs risk</li>
          <li>Children &lt;2 months: safety not established; use under medical direction</li>
          <li>Existing skin inflammation/breakdown may increase absorption and irritation</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h3>Adverse effects</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Local: burning, stinging, tingling, pruritus (itching may persist after mite eradication due to hypersensitivity)</li>
          <li>Erythema, rash, numbness at application site</li>
          <li>Contact dermatitis (uncommon)</li>
          <li>Systemic effects rare (minimal absorption through intact skin)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h3>Preparation &amp; administration</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scabies:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Shower/bathe before application; dry skin thoroughly</li>
              <li>Apply cream from neck down (include all skin folds, under nails, between fingers/toes, genitals, soles of feet)</li>
              <li>For infants/young children or immunocompromised: may need to apply to head/scalp as well (follow medical direction)</li>
              <li>Leave on 8–14 hours; wash off thoroughly with soap and water</li>
              <li>Put on clean clothes and wash all bedding/clothing in hot water after treatment</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Environmental measures:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Treat all household/close contacts simultaneously to prevent re-infestation</li>
              <li>Wash all clothing, bedding, towels in hot water (≥50°C/122°F) and dry on high heat</li>
              <li>Items that cannot be washed: seal in plastic bag for 72 hours (scabies mites die without human host)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Counsel: itching may persist 2–4 weeks after successful treatment due to hypersensitivity reaction to dead mites (does not indicate treatment failure)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h3>Monitoring</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Skin examination for resolution of lesions/burrows (scabies) or lice/nits (pediculosis)</li>
          <li>Persistent itching beyond 2–4 weeks or new burrows/lesions may indicate treatment failure or re-infestation</li>
          <li>Local skin reaction (significant erythema, blistering, or severe irritation)</li>
          <li>Confirm all close contacts treated to prevent re-infestation</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h3>At-sea considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Scabies can spread rapidly in close-quarters living; treat all close contacts and cabin-mates simultaneously</li>
          <li>Emphasize environmental decontamination: hot-water laundry, sealing non-washable items, thorough cabin cleaning</li>
          <li>Distinguish treatment failure from post-scabies pruritus (persistent itching after cure); avoid over-treatment</li>
          <li>If crusted (Norwegian) scabies suspected (hyperkeratotic, widespread): requires more aggressive treatment and medical consultation (highly contagious)</li>
          <li>Document affected individuals, treatment dates, and close contacts for outbreak tracking</li>
        </ul>
