      <h1>Silver Sulfadiazine</h1>

      <div class="content">
        <h3>Stocked on board</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Silver Sulfadiazine 1% Cream</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h3>Adult dosing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Second- and third-degree burns</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Apply 1% cream to a thickness of approximately 1/16 inch (1–2 mm) to cover the burned area</li>
              <li>Apply once or twice daily using sterile technique</li>
              <li>Keep burn covered with cream at all times; reapply if removed by patient activity or wound care</li>
              <li>Continue until healing is progressing or until site is ready for grafting</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h3>Indications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Prevention and treatment of infection in second- and third-degree burns</li>
          <li>Adjunct to burn wound management to reduce bacterial colonization</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h3>Contraindications / cautions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Known hypersensitivity to silver sulfadiazine, sulfonamides, or any component of the cream</li>
          <li>Avoid use in premature infants or neonates less than 2 months of age (risk of kernicterus from sulfonamide)</li>
          <li>Pregnancy (especially near term): sulfonamides may increase risk of kernicterus in newborn; use only if clearly needed</li>
          <li>Breastfeeding: use with caution; sulfonamides excreted in breast milk</li>
          <li>G6PD deficiency: sulfonamides may cause hemolytic anemia in susceptible patients</li>
          <li>Hepatic or renal impairment: monitor for systemic sulfonamide accumulation with extensive burns</li>
          <li>Avoid use on face near eyes or on large areas of the body without medical supervision (systemic absorption risk)</li>
          <li>Prolonged use may lead to fungal superinfection or resistant organisms</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h3>Adverse effects</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Burning sensation at application site (usually transient)</li>
          <li>Skin discoloration (gray or blue-gray; reversible)</li>
          <li>Rash, itching, or allergic contact dermatitis</li>
          <li>Leukopenia (transient; usually resolves without discontinuation; monitor CBC in extensive burns)</li>
          <li>Rare: hemolytic anemia (especially in G6PD deficiency), interstitial nephritis, hepatotoxicity</li>
          <li>Hypersensitivity reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis—rare)</li>
          <li>Fungal superinfection with prolonged use</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h3>Preparation &amp; administration</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Clean and debride burn wound as appropriate before application</li>
          <li>Apply using sterile technique (sterile gloves or sterile applicator)</li>
          <li>Apply to thickness of approximately 1/16 inch (1–2 mm) to cover entire burn area</li>
          <li>Reapply cream whenever it is removed by patient activity or during dressing changes</li>
          <li>May be used with or without dressings depending on burn management protocol</li>
          <li>Continue therapy until burn is healed or ready for grafting</li>
          <li>If cream darkens (due to reaction with wound exudate), this is expected and does not indicate loss of efficacy</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h3>Monitoring</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Wound healing progress and signs of infection (increasing redness, purulent drainage, fever)</li>
          <li>Allergic reaction or hypersensitivity (rash, worsening pain, systemic symptoms)</li>
          <li>For extensive burns: monitor CBC (especially WBC count) every 2–3 days during first weeks of therapy (leukopenia screening)</li>
          <li>Renal and hepatic function if extensive burns or prolonged use (systemic absorption risk)</li>
          <li>Signs of fungal superinfection (especially with prolonged use)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rule"></div>

        <h3>At-sea considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Essential for burn management in remote settings where infection risk is high</li>
          <li>Ensure proper wound cleaning and debridement before application to maximize efficacy</li>
          <li>Use sterile technique to minimize contamination and infection risk</li>
          <li>For large or severe burns, prioritize evacuation while initiating therapy</li>
          <li>Document burn size (% body surface area), depth, and location for continuity of care</li>
          <li>Limited lab monitoring at sea: prioritize clinical assessment for signs of infection, healing, or adverse effects</li>
          <li>Store at room temperature; do not freeze; protect from light</li>
          <li>Screen for sulfonamide allergy history before use</li>
        </ul>
