  subtitle:'Chapter 5 — Advanced Procedures',
  chapter:5,
  intro:'<p>This chapter converts the decision pathways from the previous chapter into hands-on action. The focus is not simply identifying when a procedure belongs in the plan; it is understanding how to set it up, perform it, confirm that it worked, and then continue caring for the patient afterward. Because the intended use case is a Royal Canadian Navy Physician Assistant working at sea, every procedure is framed through a practical lens: limited personnel, finite stock, ship movement, delayed evacuation, and the need to maintain the intervention over time.</p>'+
  '<h3>Purpose of This Chapter</h3>'+
  '<p>The aim of this chapter is to make the major ACTT procedures usable at the bedside. Each section is built to answer the practical questions that matter under pressure: when to do the procedure, when not to do it, what equipment to gather, how to prepare the patient and team, what sequence to follow, how to confirm success, and what immediate complications to expect.</p>'+
  '<ul><li>Translate high-risk procedures into repeatable bedside sequences.</li>'+
  '<li>Emphasize execution, confirmation, and reassessment rather than theory alone.</li>'+
  '<li>Integrate medication, monitoring, and post-procedure care into the same workflow.</li>'+
  '<li>Adapt each procedure to an at-sea, prolonged-care setting where the intervention may need to be maintained for hours.</li></ul>'+
  '<h3>How to Use This Chapter</h3>'+
  '<p>This chapter should be read like a working checklist. During study, it can be used to rehearse the order of actions. During practical preparation, it can be used to build equipment checklists, role assignments, and mental models for complications. In real use, the value of the chapter is in its structure: indication, setup, execution, confirmation, and aftercare.</p>'+
  '<ul><li>Review the indication first. A technically correct procedure performed for the wrong reason can still harm the patient.</li>'+
  '<li>Read the setup and backup plan before the step-by-step technique.</li>'+
  '<li>Treat confirmation and reassessment as part of the procedure, not optional extras.</li>'+
  '<li>If evacuation is delayed, transition quickly from procedure completion to maintenance planning.</li></ul>'+
  '<h3>Standard Procedure Format</h3>'+
  '<p>For consistency, every procedure in this chapter follows the same format. This makes the chapter easier to learn and faster to use under stress. The repeated structure also helps identify what is missing if the team is rushing: indication, equipment, backup plan, confirmation, or post-procedure monitoring.</p>'+

  '<h3>Pre-Procedure Fundamentals</h3>'+
  '<p>Before any invasive procedure, there are recurring fundamentals that determine whether the intervention runs smoothly or turns into a cascade of avoidable problems. These fundamentals apply to nearly every procedure in ACTT.</p>'+
  '<h4>Immediate Pre-Procedure Assessment</h4>'+
  '<p>Confirm the indication and urgency before starting. Ask whether the procedure is definitive, temporizing, or only a bridge to something else. If the patient is crashing, there may be no time for a full setup, but there is still time to state the indication, identify the immediate threat, and commit to the most direct life-saving action.</p>'+
  '<ul><li>Reassess airway, breathing, and circulation before starting.</li>'+
  '<li>Identify whether the patient is too unstable to delay for ideal preparation.</li>'+
  '<li>Clarify whether the procedure is expected to fix the problem or only buy time.</li>'+
  '<li>If a competing threat is greater than the indication for the procedure, address the greater threat first.</li></ul>'+
  '<h4>Team Preparation</h4>'+
  '<p>A short briefing improves success rates and reduces errors. In invasive procedures, even a ten-second statement of plan, backup, and failure point can prevent major delays. The operator should say what is about to happen, what the backup plan is, and what the team should announce if deterioration occurs.</p>'+
  '<ul><li>Assign an operator, assistant, medication handler, and monitor watcher if staffing permits.</li>'+
  '<li>State the primary plan and the immediate rescue plan out loud.</li>'+
  '<li>Confirm who is responsible for suction, oxygen, medication, and securing the device afterward.</li>'+
  '<li>Use closed-loop communication so critical actions are confirmed, not assumed.</li></ul>'+
  '<h4>Monitoring Requirements</h4>'+
  '<p>Monitoring is part of the procedure. SpO2, heart rhythm, blood pressure, and mental status should be observed before, during, and after the intervention. For airway procedures and sedation, EtCO2 should be used whenever available. The operator may be focused on the technical task, so one team member should be explicitly assigned to monitor trends and call out deterioration.</p>'+
  '<h4>Procedural Sedation and Analgesia Principles</h4>'+
  '<p>Not every urgent procedure allows time for full sedation, but pain control and anxiolysis still matter whenever feasible. The balance is between comfort and safety. Some procedures, such as a crashing chest decompression, may proceed with little or no analgesia because delay is more dangerous than pain. Others, such as chest tubes or shoulder reduction in a stable patient, benefit substantially from local anesthesia, ketamine, or other sedatives. After any sedative or opioid, airway and respiratory reassessment is mandatory.</p>'+
  '<h4>Infection Control and Sterility</h4>'+
  '<p>In austere or emergent settings, perfect sterility may not be possible, but deliberate clean technique still reduces complications. The operator should know which parts must remain as clean as possible: the insertion site, sterile instruments, and the device entering the patient. If the choice is between immediate life-saving action and waiting for ideal sterility, life-saving action takes priority, but contamination should still be minimized.</p>',

      content:'<p>Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) is used to establish a definitive airway quickly while minimizing aspiration risk and reducing prolonged struggling for the airway. Within ACTT, RSI is not only an airway procedure; it is also a structured sequence that depends on preparation, attempt discipline, rescue planning, and post-intubation management.</p>'+
      '<h4>Indications</h4>'+
      '<ul>'+
      '<li>GCS 8 or less, or inability to protect the airway.</li>'+
      '<li>Respiratory failure or exhaustion requiring controlled oxygenation and ventilation.</li>'+
      '<li>Severe agitation or combativeness preventing safe care when sedation alone is inadequate.</li>'+
      '<li>Anticipated airway deterioration such as inhalation injury or progressive facial swelling.</li>'+
      '</ul>'+
      '<h4>Contraindications and Cautions</h4>'+
      '<ul>'+
      '<li>Massive facial trauma, complete upper airway obstruction, or anatomy that makes oral intubation effectively impossible may require immediate surgical airway instead.</li>'+
      '<li>Do not continue repeated attempts when the airway is predicted difficult and oxygenation is worsening.</li>'+
      '<li>Ketamine used for RSI should be paired with a paralytic when the plan is formal intubation; ketamine alone can increase laryngospasm risk.</li>'+
      '</ul>'+
      '<h4>Required Equipment and Setup</h4>'+
      '<ul>'+
      '<li>Laryngoscope or video laryngoscope, appropriately sized endotracheal tube, bougie or stylet.</li>'+
      '<li>Bag-valve-mask, oxygen source, suction, and EtCO2 confirmation device.</li>'+
      '<li>Induction and paralytic medications drawn up, labeled, and immediately available.</li>'+
      '<li>Backup airway device and cricothyroidotomy kit opened or at arm\'s reach before the first attempt.</li>'+

      '<div class="procedure-step"><div class="ps-num">8</div><div class="ps-text">If the permitted attempts fail or the patient cannot be oxygenated, move immediately to the rescue airway plan rather than repeating low-yield attempts.</div></div>'+
      '<h4>Confirmation</h4>'+
      '<ul>'+
      '<li>Use EtCO2 to confirm tracheal placement as the strongest immediate confirmation tool.</li>'+
      '<li>Check chest rise, bilateral breath sounds, and tube depth marking.</li>'+
      '<li>Secure the tube well, then set initial ventilation targets based on the clinical problem.</li>'+
      '<li>Begin ongoing sedation after intubation; an intubated patient still requires analgesia and sedation.</li>'+
      '</ul>'+
      '<h4>Endotracheal Intubation Optimization</h4>'+
      '<p>RSI is only as good as the mechanics supporting first-pass success. The course material emphasizes difficult airway prediction and deliberate techniques to improve glottic view and reduce failed attempts.</p>'+
      '<p><strong>Airway Assessment:</strong> Use LEMON to predict difficult laryngoscopy and BONES to predict difficult bag-mask ventilation. The practical value is not academic scoring; it is deciding before the first attempt whether you should expect a poor view, a poor bagging situation, or both.</p>'+
      '<p><strong>View Optimization:</strong></p>'+
      '<ul>'+
      '<li>Use positioning and external laryngeal manipulation, including BURP where useful, to improve glottic view.</li>'+
      '<li>Apply the practical concepts often summarized as the \'Kovacs Kata\': optimize neck and head position, improve hand mechanics, manage the epiglottis deliberately, and adjust by slight pull-back if the tube trajectory is poor.</li>'+
      '<li>Use a bougie early when only a partial view is obtained rather than persisting with a poor blind tube pass.</li>'+
      '</ul>'+
      '<p><strong>Tube Confirmation and Securement:</strong> Confirmation does not end with one good breath. The tube must stay where it belongs. In burn patients, adhesive tape may fail on injured skin, so circumferential ties or other securement methods are safer.</p>'+
      '<h4>Complications and Troubleshooting</h4>'+
      '<ul>'+
      '<li>Esophageal intubation: suspect if no EtCO2, poor chest rise, and rapid desaturation. Remove and reattempt only if still within the permitted attempt plan.</li>'+
      '<li>Hypoxia: pause, re-oxygenate, suction, and reassess before further attempts.</li>'+
      '<li>Hypotension after induction: support perfusion immediately and reconsider sedation burden.</li>'+
      '<li>Tube dislodgement after successful placement: prevent with proper securement and deliberate handling.</li>'+
      '</ul>'+
