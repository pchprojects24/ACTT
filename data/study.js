  subtitle:'Chapter 12 — Study System and Review Framework',
  chapter:12,
  intro:'<p>This chapter turns the manual into a practical study system. It is designed to help you prepare before the course, refresh rapidly before skills stations, consolidate learning during the course, and retain high-consequence material afterward. The emphasis is on recall, sequencing, execution, and safe application under pressure.</p><h4>Why This Chapter Matters (12.1)</h4><p>ACTT content is too broad and operationally critical to be learned by passive reading alone. High-acuity performance depends on threshold recognition, quick sequencing, procedural mental rehearsal, and repeated exposure to common error traps.</p><p>The study problem is not simply knowing the content. The real requirement is being able to recognize the presentation, state the next action, execute the intervention in the right order, and continue reassessment after the first step. This chapter is structured to support that transition from recognition to action.</p><p>Because the course content mixes trauma, airway, critical care, medications, prolonged holding, and shipboard adaptation, the learner needs a repeatable system for deciding what to study first, what to memorize exactly, and what to rehearse as a workflow.</p><h4>How to Use This Chapter (12.2)</h4><p>Use this chapter as a study framework rather than a narrative reading section. It should guide how you spend limited review time and help you choose the correct review method for each type of material.</p><p>For any topic in the manual, ask: What must I memorize exactly? What must I understand conceptually? What must I be able to perform as a sequence? What is the common failure point after the first intervention? If you cannot answer those questions, the topic is not yet course-ready.</p><p>This chapter supports both longer structured sessions and short review blocks. In practice, it should help you move quickly between rapid threshold review, algorithm walkthroughs, procedure rehearsal, medication recall, and prolonged-hold planning.</p>',

      title:'Study Prioritization Strategy',
      content:'<h3>12.3 Study Prioritization Strategy</h3>' +
        '<p>Not all material deserves equal time. The highest priority content is the content most likely to drive immediate survival decisions and the content most likely to fail under stress if it has not been actively rehearsed.</p>' +

        '<h4>First-Priority Topics</h4>' +
        '<p>First-priority topics should be mastered first: airway and respiratory emergencies; RSI and failed-airway logic; shock and perfusion targets; TBI management; burn airway and fluid resuscitation; sedation and analgesia dosing; prolonged holding basics; and major numeric triggers. These topics recur across multiple chapters because they are both high-yield and high-consequence.</p>' +

        '<h4>Second-Priority Topics</h4>' +
        '<p>Second-priority content includes the sepsis pathway, STEMI and fibrinolysis, hypothermia details, chest tube specifics, pericardiocentesis, and detailed antibiotic regimens. These are still important, but they are often more situational or less frequent.</p>' +

        '<h4>Third-Priority Topics</h4>' +
        '<p>Third-priority content includes lower-frequency rescue nuances, less commonly used medications, finer substitution pathways, and specific equipment variations. These should still be reviewed, but not before the high-frequency core has been made dependable.</p>',

      content:'<h3>12.4 What Must Be Memorized Versus What Must Be Understood</h3>' +

        '<h4>Memorization-Critical Material</h4>' +
        '<p>Memorization-critical material includes hard thresholds, fixed time windows, drug doses that trigger action, procedural attempt limits, red-flag contraindications, and core formulas. Examples include GCS &lt;= 8, SBP &gt; 110 mmHg in TBI, MAP &gt;= 65 mmHg in septic shock, EtCO2 targets, the Rule of 10s, urine output targets, tenecteplase weight bands, and RSI attempt rules.</p>' +

        '<h4>Concept-Heavy Material</h4>' +
        '<p>Concept-heavy material requires a clear understanding of why a rule exists so that it can be applied safely in context. Examples include why hyperventilation is restricted in TBI, why burn fluids are a starting point rather than a fixed order, why shock type changes fluid-versus-pressor decisions, and why a technically successful procedure can still fail later if it is not maintained.</p>' +

        '<h4>Sequence-Based Material</h4>' +
        '<p>Sequence-based material should be studied as a workflow rather than as isolated facts. RSI, failed-airway progression, chest tube insertion, sepsis response, TBI neuroprotection, and formal handover all require ordered execution. If the sequence is not stable in memory, performance slows and error rates rise.</p>',

      title:'Recommended Study Order',
      content:'<h3>12.5 Recommended Study Order for This Manual</h3>' +
        '<p>The most efficient study order is not simply chapter 1 through chapter 13. Start with the framework chapters to build the mental map: Chapter 2 (Course Framework and Priorities), Chapter 3 (Clinical Domains Overview), and Chapter 8 (Numeric Thresholds and Critical Targets). These establish what matters and what numbers drive action.</p>' +
        '<p>Once the framework is in place, move into the high-yield action chapters: Chapter 4 (Major Algorithms and Decision Pathways), Chapter 5 (Advanced Procedures), and Chapter 6 (Medication Reference). These chapters answer what to do, how to do it, and how to medicate the patient safely.</p>' +
        '<p>After the action chapters, shift to sustainment and operational chapters: Chapter 7 (Prolonged Holding and Delayed MEDEVAC), Chapter 9 (Critical Errors, Pitfalls, and Do Not Miss Items), Chapter 10 (Shipboard Application), and Chapter 11 (Team, Communication, and Operational Practice). These chapters are what keep the patient safe after the first intervention and what make the plan workable at sea.</p>' +
        '<p>Finish with integrated review. Revisit algorithms, medications, thresholds, and pitfalls together rather than rereading linearly. The goal is to connect the material so that one clinical problem automatically triggers the associated threshold, medication, procedural setup, and maintenance burden.</p>',

      title:'Study Methods by Content Type',
      content:'<h3>12.6 Study Methods by Content Type</h3>' +

        '<h4>Algorithms</h4>' +
        '<p>Algorithms are best studied as decision trees: entry condition, first action, branch point, reassessment, escalation. The most useful method is verbal walkthrough. State the presentation, state the first threat, state the first action, then ask what would make you change course.</p>' +

        '<h4>Procedures</h4>' +
        '<p>Procedures are best studied as indication, setup, landmarks, ordered steps, confirmation, complications, and aftercare. Mental rehearsal is particularly useful. If possible, narrate the procedure out loud and include the backup plan and the failure trigger, not only the ideal technical steps.</p>' +

        '<h4>Medications</h4>' +
        '<p>Medications should be studied by indication first, then dose, then preparation and administration, then monitoring and common errors. Drug cards, grouped comparisons, and route-and-dose recall drills are more effective than reading a long list repeatedly.</p>' +

        '<h4>Numeric Targets</h4>' +
        '<p>Numeric targets should be reviewed as number-to-action links. The useful question is not just What is the number? but What does this number make me do? Threshold tables and rapid-fire drills work well here.</p>' +

        '<h4>Prolonged-Hold Content</h4>' +
        '<p>Prolonged-hold content is best studied as a maintenance cycle: reassessment rhythm, device maintenance, medication continuity, and escalation triggers. This material is learned best through planning drills framed around 1-hour, 6-hour, and 24-hour checkpoints.</p>',

      title:'Scenario-Based Self-Testing',
      content:'<h3>12.7 Scenario-Based Self-Testing Framework</h3>' +

        '<h4>Immediate-Action Scenarios</h4>' +
        '<p>Short immediate-action scenarios should be used to test recognition and first-step decision-making. Useful examples include the GCS-dropping trauma patient, suspected tension pneumothorax, combative head-injured casualty, septic hypotension, and the patient with impending airway burn swelling.</p>' +

        '<h4>Procedure-Trigger Scenarios</h4>' +
        '<p>Procedure-trigger scenarios should ask whether the procedure is indicated, what must be prepared, who should do what, and what the backup plan is. Examples include failed airway, tube thoracostomy after decompression, IO after failed IV access, and Foley placement in burn resuscitation.</p>' +

        '<h4>Medication-Selection Scenarios</h4>' +
        '<p>Medication-selection scenarios should test drug choice, dose, preparation, administration, and required monitoring. High-value examples include active seizure, procedural sedation, pressor-dependent hypotension, STEMI with delayed PCI, and pain control during prolonged holding.</p>' +

        '<h4>Prolonged-Hold Scenarios</h4>' +
        '<p>Prolonged-hold scenarios should test trend thinking. Ask what must be trended, what is likely to fail next, what needs re-dosing, and what change would make holding no longer safe. Examples include an intubated burn patient, a pressor-supported septic patient, a TBI patient with worsening pupils, and a chest-tube patient with declining oxygenation.</p>',

      content:'<h3>12.8 Rapid Review Tools</h3>' +

        '<h4>1-Minute Review</h4>' +
        '<p>A 1-minute review should be used for the smallest high-yield refresh. Limit it to airway triggers, shock targets, key drug doses, and red-flag pitfalls. The point is not to feel prepared; it is to reactivate the most failure-prone information quickly.</p>' +

        '<h4>5-Minute Review</h4>' +
        '<p>A 5-minute review should cover one system cluster only. Examples include a TBI block, a burn block, a sepsis block, an RSI block, a sedation block, or a prolonged-hold essentials block. Keep the review structured: triggers, first actions, key drugs, common failures.</p>' +

        '<h4>Pre-Scenario Review</h4>' +
        '<p>A pre-scenario review should focus on what is likely to matter in the next exercise: likely algorithm, likely equipment, likely drugs, likely failure points, and likely handover moments. This is the most practical way to use the manual immediately before course activity.</p>' +

        '<h4>End-of-Day Consolidation Review</h4>' +
        '<p>An end-of-day consolidation review should identify what felt slow, what thresholds were forgotten, what sequence broke down, and what needs another pass. This is more effective for retention than rereading everything that was covered that day.</p>',

        '<p>Stress degrades memory retrieval and sequence control. The study method therefore has to include spoken recall, not just silent reading. Saying the sequence out loud helps stabilize action order for airway plans, procedures, medication administration sequences, and handovers.</p>' +
        '<p>Practice next-step thinking. Repeatedly ask: What is the next action? What would make me change course? What must I reassess after this? This mirrors ACTT performance more closely than fact-recognition questions.</p>' +
        '<p>Practice failure thinking as well. Ask: What if this does not work? What if the patient worsens? What is my backup plan? This is especially important for airway, chest procedures, pressor support, and prolonged holding because these are the areas in which the first intervention can appear to work and then fail later.</p>',

      content:'<h3>12.10 Review by Likely Course-Relevant Themes</h3>' +
        '<p>Review in clusters rather than isolated facts.</p>' +

        '<h4>Airway Cluster</h4>' +
        '<p>The airway cluster should include airway thresholds, RSI, failed airway, post-intubation sedation, oxygenation and ventilation targets, and tube securement. The value of this cluster method is that it mirrors the way airway problems actually present and evolve.</p>' +

        '<h4>Shock Cluster</h4>' +
        '<p>The shock cluster should include shock recognition, fluids versus blood versus pressors, perfusion targets, reassessment after bolus, and vasopressor pitfalls. The learner should be able to move from recognition to a resuscitation and monitoring plan without pausing to rebuild the system from scratch.</p>' +

        '<h4>TBI Cluster</h4>' +
        '<p>The TBI cluster should include GCS, BP targets, EtCO2 targets, herniation signs, hypertonic saline or mannitol use, seizure control, and repeated neuro checks. The core aim is neuroprotection through avoidance of secondary injury.</p>' +

        '<h4>Burn Cluster</h4>' +
        '<p>The burn cluster should include airway decisions, TBSA, the Rule of 10s, urine output targets, escharotomy triggers, and prolonged fluid adjustment. This cluster is particularly important because the initial formula is only the start of the management task.</p>' +

        '<h4>Sedation and Analgesia Cluster</h4>' +
        '<p>The sedation and analgesia cluster should include ketamine, midazolam, hydromorphone, fentanyl, morphine, dosing separation, airway risk after sedation, and re-dosing safety over time. This is a high-risk cluster because drug success and drug harm can look very similar early on.</p>' +

        '<h4>Prolonged-Holding Cluster</h4>' +
        '<p>The prolonged-holding cluster should include reassessment rhythm, device maintenance, medication continuity, trend recognition, documentation, and escalation triggers. This cluster is what prevents the patient from being lost after successful initial stabilization.</p>',

      title:'Common Study Errors',
      content:'<h3>12.11 Common Study Errors</h3>' +
        '<p>Reading without retrieval practice is one of the most common failures. Recognition of familiar text can create false confidence, but ACTT performance requires recall without prompts. Use active recall after each section: close the page and state the main triggers, actions, and pitfalls.</p>' +
        '<p>Memorizing details without action context is another major error. If the fact is not linked to what it changes clinically, it is less likely to be usable under stress. Tie every number, drug, and procedural step to the question: What would this make me do?</p>' +
        '<p>Studying rare details before high-yield basics creates a weak operational foundation. Master high-frequency and high-consequence content first. Rare rescue nuances are useful only after the common critical pathways are stable.</p>' +
        '<p>Reviewing procedures without rehearsing the sequence is inefficient. Knowing the equipment list or the indication is not enough. The step order, confirmation, complication recognition, and post-procedure maintenance burden must all be part of the rehearsal.</p>' +
        '<p>Ignoring pitfalls and maintenance tasks produces fragile learning. Many learners remember the first intervention but not what causes later deterioration. Always review reassessment, device checks, medication timing, and common failure points alongside the initial treatment.</p>',

      content:'<h3>12.12 Practical Course-Prep Review Structure</h3>' +

        '<h4>Short Review Session</h4>' +
        '<p>A short review session should include one rapid threshold review, one algorithm, one procedure, one medication cluster, one pitfall cluster, and one brief self-test. This structure keeps the session balanced and prevents overfocusing on one comfortable topic.</p>' +

        '<h4>Longer Review Session</h4>' +
        '<p>A longer review session should include one major system block, one procedure walkthrough, one medication comparison set, one prolonged-hold scenario, one handover drill, and one error review. This format better reflects how the course integrates technical and operational content.</p>' +

        '<h4>Final Pre-Course Review</h4>' +
        '<p>A final pre-course review should concentrate on airway, shock, TBI, burns, sedation, prolonged holding, major thresholds, and common pitfalls. The goal immediately before the course is to stabilize the high-yield core, not to relearn every chapter from scratch.</p>' +

        '<h4>12.13 Using This Manual During the Course</h4>' +
        '<p>Before skills stations, review indications, key steps, failure triggers, complications, and post-procedure priorities. This is the fastest way to prime technical performance without overloading yourself with low-yield detail at the last minute.</p>' +
        '<p>Before scenario work, review likely algorithms, threshold triggers, communication structure, and likely next deterioration. This keeps you focused on progression and reassessment rather than only the first intervention.</p>' +
        '<p>After scenarios or teaching blocks, review what was missed, what felt slow, what thresholds were forgotten, and what sequence broke down. Those identified weak points should directly shape the next study block. The manual is most useful when it is used to close specific performance gaps, not only to reread familiar material.</p>' +

        '<h4>12.14 End State for the Learner</h4>' +
        '<p>After working through this chapter, the learner should be able to study the manual deliberately and efficiently, prioritize the highest-yield material first, and distinguish between memorization, conceptual understanding, and sequence rehearsal.</p>' +
        '<p>The learner should also be able to use active recall and scenario practice to improve retention, build faster bedside recognition, and convert passive reading into more reliable execution under stress.</p>' +
        '<p>The intended end state is not perfect recall of every line. It is dependable performance on the high-consequence tasks most likely to matter during ACTT training and in shipboard casualty care afterward.</p>',
